To remove last migration:

dotnet ef migrations remove
or
PM> Remove-Migration
To remove all migrations:

just remove Migrations folder.

To remove last few migrations (not all):

There is no a command to remove a bunch of migrations and we can't just remove these few migrations and their *.designer.cs files since we need to keep the snapshot file in the consistent state. We need to remove migrations one by one (see To remove last migration above).

To unapply and remove last migration:

dotnet ef migrations remove --force
or
PM> Remove-Migration -Force
